# Alphabet Soup Neural Network Analysis

The analyst works as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked the analyst to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given the analyst a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With their knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, the analyst will decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.
